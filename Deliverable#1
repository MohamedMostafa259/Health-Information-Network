### III. Use Cases: Event Decomposition Technique

Use the **Event Decomposition Technique** to identify use cases.

1. **Identify External Events**:
   - Events that trigger responses from the system, e.g., "Patient requests an appointment."
   - Example Use Cases:
     - *Schedule Appointment*
     - *View Health Records*
     - *Update Treatment Details*

2. **Identify Temporal Events**:
   - Events based on time, such as "Notification for appointment reminder."
   - Example Use Cases:
     - *Send Appointment Reminder*
     - *Generate Daily Compliance Report for Regulators*

3. **Identify State Events**:
   - Changes in the state of an object, like "Insurance claim submitted."
   - Example Use Cases:
     - *Process Insurance Claim*
     - *Update Patient Insurance Status*

**Table of Events and Use Cases** (sample format):

| Event Type         | User/Stakeholder         | Event Description                           | Use Case                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| External Event     | Patient                  | Patient requests appointment                | Schedule Appointment           |
| External Event     | Healthcare Provider      | Provider accesses patient record            | View Health Records            |
| Temporal Event     | System                   | Daily compliance report for regulators      | Generate Compliance Report     |
| State Event        | Insurance Company        | Insurance claim submitted                   | Process Insurance Claim        |

4. **Brief Use Case Descriptions**:
   For each identified use case, provide a brief description with steps to achieve it.
   
   Example:

   | Use Case             | Description                                                                                   |
   |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schedule Appointment | Allows a patient to request an appointment with a healthcare provider.                        |
   | View Health Records  | Enables healthcare providers to access the patient's health history and treatment details.    |
   | Process Insurance Claim | Verifies the patient's insurance coverage and processes claims for payment.               |
   | Generate Compliance Report | Creates a report of healthcare provider activities for government review.               |

5. **UML Use Case Diagram**:
   Create a UML Use Case Diagram to visually represent these use cases. The diagram should include:
   - **Actors**: Patient, Healthcare Provider, Insurance Company, Government Regulator.
   - **Use Cases**: Represent the identified cases, such as *View Health Records*, *Schedule Appointment*, *Process Insurance Claim*, etc.
   - **Relationships**: Show associations between actors and use cases (e.g., Patient -> Schedule Appointment).

These sections should provide a comprehensive start for Deliverable #1. Let me know if you'd like guidance on any specific part, like crafting detailed acceptance criteria or UML diagram examples!

Thanks for sharing the criteria! Here’s how these criteria can guide us in identifying **use cases** for your Health Information Network (HIN) project:

---

### External Events and Use Cases

Based on the external events criteria, we can identify use cases that fulfill each specific need:

1. **External Agent Wants a Transaction**:
   - *Schedule Appointment*: A patient initiates an appointment request with a healthcare provider.
   - *Submit Insurance Claim*: A healthcare provider or patient submits a claim for medical services to the insurance company.
   - *Update Treatment Details*: A healthcare provider updates a patient's treatment details in the system.

2. **External Agent Wants Some Information**:
   - *View Health Records*: Patients and healthcare providers access the patient's health history.
   - *Check Insurance Coverage*: Patients or healthcare providers check whether a treatment is covered by the patient’s insurance.
   - *Generate Patient Reports*: Government regulators or healthcare providers request reports on patient care or health statistics.

3. **Data Changed and Needs to Be Updated**:
   - *Update Patient Profile*: Patients or healthcare providers update patient information, such as contact details or medical history.
   - *Update Insurance Status*: Insurance companies update the status of a patient's coverage after processing claims.
   - *Record Payment Transactions*: The system records payments made by insurance companies or patients.

4. **Management Wants Some Information**:
   - *Generate Compliance Report*: A report is generated for government regulators to monitor compliance with healthcare standards.
   - *Generate Usage Summary*: A report provides information on system usage statistics for management oversight.

### Temporal Events and Use Cases

For temporal events, we can identify use cases based on the timing and frequency of certain reports or internal outputs:

1. **Internal Outputs Needed**:
   - *Send Appointment Reminder*: An automated reminder is sent to patients a day or a few hours before their scheduled appointment.
   - *Daily Activity Log*: Generates a daily log of activities for auditing purposes.

2. **Management Reports**:
   - *Generate Monthly Compliance Report*: A monthly summary report is created for government regulators or management to ensure regulatory compliance.
   - *Generate Insurance Claims Summary*: A summary report of all claims processed within a specific time frame is generated for management or regulatory bodies.

3. **Operational Reports**:
   - *Generate Treatment Report*: A detailed report of patient treatments is generated for internal review or regulatory purposes.
   - *Insurance Claims Detailed Report*: Generates a report on the claims processed for auditing and analysis.

4. **External Outputs Needed**:
   - *Send Billing Statement*: Monthly billing statements are sent to patients or insurance companies.
   - *Send Appointment Confirmation*: A confirmation message is sent to patients after they schedule an appointment.
